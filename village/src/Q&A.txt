1. Q: Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side  routing
   
   A: With server side routing, every time we try to access any part of the      
      data, first, the server has to be contacted, and then we get the data      
      that we wanted, and this happens every time we route to a different        
      link.

      With Client Side routing, the first time we access our website, we get 
      all the data at once, so there is no necesity to contact the server every time we 
      link to a different component.
